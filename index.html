          taught me to live with the motto, ‘Never stop dreaming’. You have informed my choices, inspired my direction and
          taught me to be thankful along the way, we both have been through some motions of life , but we still hope to
          achieve excellence. As you celebrate this amazing day, may your mind be renewed with hope of accomplishing more in
          life. Thank you for being awesome Stay blessed and highly favored Happy birthday Cray 🎂🥂 <br>-Gugu</p>
