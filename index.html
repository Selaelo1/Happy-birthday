        <h2>A BIT ABOUT OUR BIRTHDAY GIRL...</h2>
        <p>Meet T, the smallest but mightiest person I've ever met, standing tall at 4'8" with a big afro and an even bigger
        personality. Born on this day in 1998, she's still got a youthful glow, but don't let that fool you - she's a force to
        be reckoned with! Easy to annoy, but trust me, you don't want to see her mad side. T's got a short attention span, but
        when she sets her mind to something, she achieves it with ease. She's a sister to two mini-mes, a friend to countless
        lucky people, a daughter to many, and a girlfriend to one (the luckiest human being alive!). But what you might not know
        is that T's also a talented rapper, known to some as Cray-Tee, spitting bars that'll leave you speechless. Her hit song
        "Cray Flow" (linked below) showcases her skills, with lines like "I don't entertain drama, I ain't no Jerry Springer"
        and "I'm a test mama, and I'm the examinator" - yeah, your favorite rapper can't touch that! And when she's not rapping,
        T's also a skilled pianist, effortlessly playing complex melodies that'll leave you wondering how someone so small can
        have such a huge talent. Oh, and here's a fun fact: despite not having aged a day since her 17th birthday (yes, you read
        that right!), T's intimidating presence means no one ever asks for her ID - she's got an aura that commands respect!
        Plus, she's the person I look to when the cashier "forgets" to give me my change - T's got my back and will speak up on
        my behalf, no question. She's the ultimate ride-or-die, most of you can relate. In short, T is the most amazing person you'll ever meet - if you disagree, well, let's just say you're wrong!</p>
