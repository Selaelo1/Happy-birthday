        <h2>A BIT ABOUT OUR BIRTHDAY GIRL...</h2>
        <p>Meet T, the smallest but mightiest person I've ever met, standing tall at 4'8" with a big afro and an even bigger
        personality. Born on this day in 1998, she's still got a youthful glow, but don't let that fool you - she's a force to
        be reckoned with! Easy to annoy, but trust me, you don't want to see her mad side. T's got a short attention span, but
        when she sets her mind to something, she achieves it with ease. She's a sister to two mini-mes, a friend to countless
        lucky people, a daughter to many, and a girlfriend to one (the luckiest human being alive!). But what you might not know
        is that T's also a talented rapper, known to some as Cray-Tee, spitting bars that'll leave you speechless. Her hit song
        "Cray Flow" (linked below) showcases her skills, with lines like "I don't entertain drama, I ain't no Jerry Springer"
        and "I'm a test mama, and I'm the examinator" - yeah, your favorite rapper can't touch that! And when she's not rapping,
        T's also a skilled pianist, effortlessly playing complex melodies that'll leave you wondering how someone so small can
        have such a huge talent. Oh, and here's a fun fact: despite not having aged a day since her 17th birthday (yes, you read
        that right!), T's intimidating presence means no one ever asks for her ID - she's got an aura that commands respect!
        Plus, she's the person you look to when the cashier "forgets" to give you your change - T's got your back and will speak up on your behalf, no question. She's the ultimate ride-or-die, most of you can relate. In short, T is the most amazing person you'll ever meet - if you disagree, well, let's just say you're wrong!</p>

    <h5>HAPPY BIRTHDAY maNALA...</h5>
    <hr>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="text-container">
        <h6>HEART TO HEART...</h6>
        <p>I wanted to create something special for your birthday, so I asked everyone closest to you to share a message and a
        picture of the two of you together. Getting pictures was the hard part (girl, you need to take more photos!), but
        writing messages was effortless – I think everyone could write a book about you! What we all have in common is our
        admiration for your kindness, your ability to see the best in everyone, and the abundance of love you share with us.
        
        As we celebrate another year of life, I wish for you to be showered with tons of money in the next 365 days – may your
        bank account be overflowing, may your investments flourish, and may your financial dreams become a reality! May you be
        able to treat yourself to everything you've ever wanted and more.
        <br>
        
        And, I wish for you to embark on an incredible international trip – may you explore new lands, immerse yourself in
        different cultures, and create unforgettable memories. May your passport be filled with stamps, and may your heart be
        filled with joy.
        <br>
        But most importantly, I wish for you to continue being your amazing self. You are the sunshine that brightens up our
        lives, and we are all so grateful to have you in our world. I hope the next 365 days bring you even more love, laughter,
        and adventure. You deserve it all!
        <br>
        You are loved, appreciated, and celebrated by all of us. Happy Birthday, and may all your dreams come true!</p>
        <br>
        -Your ultimate fave.
