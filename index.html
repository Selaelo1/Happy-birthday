        <h2>A BIT ABOUT OUR BIRTHDAY GIRL...</h2>
        <p>Meet T, the smallest but mightiest person I've ever met, standing tall at 4'8" with a big afro and an even bigger
          personality. Born on this day in 1998, she's still got a youthful glow, but don't let that fool you - she's a
          force to be reckoned with! Easy to annoy, but trust me, you don't want to see her mad side. T's got a short
          attention span, but when she sets her mind to something, she achieves it with ease. She's a sister to two
          mini-mes, a friend to countless lucky people, a daughter to many, and a girlfriend to one (me, the luckiest person
          alive!). But what you might not know is that T's also a talented rapper, known to some as Cray-Tee, spitting bars
          that'll leave you speechless. Her hit song "Cray Flow" (linked below) showcases her skills, with lines like "I
          don't entertain drama, I ain't no Jerry Springer" and "I'm a test mama, and I'm the examinator" - yeah, your
          favorite rapper can't touch that! And when she's not rapping, T's also a skilled pianist, effortlessly playing
          complex melodies that'll leave you wondering how someone so small can have such a huge talent. In short, T is the
          most amazing person you'll ever meet - if you disagree, well, let's just say you're wrong!</p>
